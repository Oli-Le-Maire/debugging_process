# Debugging Process


1.	Have you understood the instructions properly

2.	Have you understood the error message properly?

3.	Write down what you understand from the error message in plain English

4.	a) Try and solve the smallest part of the error
b) Solve that part
c) return to 'a'

5.	Google the error if still struggling

6.	If you are still struggling, do one or both of the following:
a)	explain the whole code as if you are explaining the issue to a rubber duck, and see if you come across anything that doesn’t add up
b)	draw a diagram of the code

7.	List your assumptions about the code and see if these assumptions are correct

8.	Print for visibility

9.	Look out for None results. This will not necessarily be picked up by inserting things like “print(hello)” as you are looking for a ‘ghost’. For example something such as string[0] on this “hello” will not pick up “hello” but will only pick up “h”

10.	Never assume. This will lead to a stressful spiral of guessing

11.	Reach out (but only as a last resort), but before you end up guessing in a spiral of frustration
